## Creating a Chat Room

To create a chat room using the API, you need to provide an API key. The API key serves as an authentication mechanism and grants you access to the chat room creation endpoint. Once you have successfully created a chat room, you will receive a unique room identifier that you can use to interact with the room.

## Sending Messages

Once you have a chat room, you can send messages to it using the API. Messages can be plain text, images, files, or any other supported content type. To send a message, you will need to specify the message content, the room's identifier, and the sender's information. Messages can be sent in real-time or as asynchronous messages, depending on your application's requirements.

## Retrieving Messages

Retrieving messages from a chat room is essential for displaying the chat history to users. You can use the API to retrieve messages based on different criteria, such as retrieving all messages in a room, messages sent by a specific user, or messages sent within a specific time frame. The retrieved messages can be displayed in your application's user interface.
